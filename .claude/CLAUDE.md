# Legal Case Management - Claude Code Orchestrator

**You are assisting with a legal case using the wepublic_defender system.**

This file provides core configuration and conditional logic to load the appropriate workflow for each situation.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Routing (READ FIRST EVERY SESSION)

**Follow this conditional logic to determine which workflow to load:**

### 1. Check for First-Time Initialization

**IF** `.wepublic_defender/case_initialized.json` does **NOT** exist in current working directory:
```
‚Üí Read and follow: `.claude/workflows/first_case_init.md`
‚Üí After completion, that workflow creates the case_initialized.json file
‚Üí This only happens once per case directory
```

### 2. Detect Post-Compacting Recovery

**IF** conversation summary indicates context was recently compacted/summarized:
```
‚Üí Read and follow: `.claude/workflows/post_compact_recovery.md`
‚Üí This helps you rebuild context from files without annoying user
‚Üí Then proceed to normal session workflow
```

### 3. Normal Session Start

**IF** case is initialized and context is intact:
```
‚Üí Read and follow: `.claude/workflows/session_start_checklist.md`
‚Üí This checks inbox, deadlines, and offers relevant next actions
```

### 4. User Requests Legal Document Work

**IF** user wants to draft, review, or file legal documents:
```
‚Üí Read and follow: `.claude/workflows/legal_document_workflow.md`
‚Üí **CRITICAL**: This contains the mandatory POST-REVIEW DECISION POINT
‚Üí **ALWAYS** follow `.claude/protocols/LEGAL_WORK_PROTOCOL.md` for quality standards
```

## üîÑ Session Management

**Refresh instructions periodically**: Every 10-15 interactions during long sessions, re-read this file to refresh routing logic.

**Multi-Model Cost Awareness**: When agent configs have multiple models (e.g., `["gpt-5", "grok-4"]`), wepublic_defender runs ALL models in parallel for adversarial redundancy. This means **2x token usage and cost**.

Periodically remind user:
- "Running both {model1} and {model2} in parallel for redundancy (doubles cost)"
- Suggest checking `.wepublic_defender/usage_log.csv` or running `wpd-usage-summary`

To run single model: Use `--model <model_name>` flag.

---

## üéØ Agent Mode Architecture (CRITICAL)

**ALL agents support TWO operating modes:**

### Mode 1: Guidance (DEFAULT - FREE)
- Returns structured prompt for Claude Code to execute
- **NO API calls** - completely free, no token usage
- Claude Code does all the work based on the guidance prompt
- Default mode to minimize costs

**When to use:**
- Most of the time (this is the default)
- When you want to review/draft/research yourself with guidance
- For file organization (organize agent ONLY supports this mode)

**Example:**
```bash
<python_path> -m wepublic_defender.cli.run_agent --agent drafter --text "Draft motion" --mode guidance
# Returns: Guidance prompt
# Cost: $0.00
```

### Mode 2: External-LLM (COSTS MONEY)
- Calls external LLM(s) configured in `.wepublic_defender/legal_review_settings.json`
- Number of models depends on agent configuration:
  - `"models": ["gpt-5"]` ‚Üí calls ONE model
  - `"models": ["gpt-5", "grok-4"]` ‚Üí calls BOTH in parallel (2x cost)
- Override with `--model <name>` flag or `--run-both` to force both

**When to use:**
- Automated validation from external LLMs
- Second opinions on critical filings
- Citation verification with web search
- Adversarial review (opposing counsel simulation)

**Example:**
```bash
<python_path> -m wepublic_defender.cli.run_agent --agent self_review --file draft.md --mode external-llm
# Calls LLM(s) from settings
# Cost: Depends on document size, models, web search
```

### Special Case: Organize Agent

`organize` agent **ONLY** operates in guidance mode - external LLMs cannot access file system.

If you try `--mode external-llm` with organize, it auto-falls back to guidance with warning.

---

## ü§ñ Agent Orchestration Protocol (CRITICAL - READ AFTER EVERY AGENT RUN)

**AFTER EVERY AGENT INVOCATION, YOU MUST CHECK FOR AND FOLLOW AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:**

When you run any agent via `wpd-run-agent` or CLI commands, the agent result contains an optional `claude_prompt` field that tells you what to do next.

### How It Works

1. **Agents have domain expertise** - They know what their findings mean and can guide your next actions
2. **You orchestrate the workflow** - Check the `claude_prompt` field after each agent run
3. **Follow agent guidance** - The prompts tell you to summarize findings, ask questions, or recommend next steps

### Example Agent Outputs

#### Self Review Found Critical Issues
```json
{
  "agent": "self_review",
  "structured": {"critical_issues": ["Missing jurisdiction", "No legal standard"], ...},
  "claude_prompt": "Found 2 CRITICAL issues that must be fixed before filing: Missing jurisdiction; No legal standard. Also 3 major and 5 minor issues. Present the critical issues as a bulleted list and ask if I should research solutions or if the user wants to review the full output first."
}
```

**What to do:** Follow the prompt! List the critical issues, ask the user how they want to proceed.

#### Citation Verification Passed
```json
{
  "agent": "citation_verify",
  "structured": [{...}, {...}],
  "claude_prompt": "All 5 citations verified as good law and supporting our position. Briefly confirm this success and ask if user wants to proceed with next review step (opposing_counsel)."
}
```

**What to do:** Confirm success to user, offer to run opposing_counsel next.

### When Agent Returns `claude_prompt`

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Read and follow the prompt instructions
- Summarize findings for the user
- Ask questions the prompt suggests
- Recommend next actions from the prompt

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Ignore the prompt and just say "Agent run complete"
- Run next agent without user feedback if prompt asks questions
- Blindly accept findings without the critical analysis the prompt may request

### Why This Matters

Agents with domain knowledge (legal review, citation verification) can intelligently guide the orchestration workflow based on what they find. This prevents you from just executing bash commands silently - you'll provide context-aware summaries and recommendations after each step.

---

## üíª OS Detection (FIRST THING EVERY SESSION)

Check `<env>` tag for platform and remember for entire session:

**Windows (win32)**:
- Edit/MultiEdit file_path: MUST use backslashes `\` (e.g., `C:\\repos\\file.txt`)
- Bash commands: Use forward slashes `/` (e.g., `"C:/repos/file.txt"`)
- Shell commands: `copy`, `move`, `del`, `dir`

**Mac/Linux (darwin/linux)**:
- All paths: forward slashes `/`
- Shell commands: `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `ls`

---

## üêç Python Environment (MANDATORY)

**On first Python command each session**: Determine absolute Python path for wepublic_defender environment.

### Environment Path Source (Case-Aware)

1. Check for `.wepublic_defender/env_info.json` in current case directory
2. If exists, load `python_exe` path from it
3. If missing, detect path and create the file:
   ```bash
   conda run -n wepublic_defender python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"
   ```
4. Save to `.wepublic_defender/env_info.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "python_exe": "C:/Users/you/.conda/envs/wepublic_defender/python.exe",
     "conda_env": "wepublic_defender",
     "repo_path": "C:/path/to/wepublic_defender"
   }
   ```

**NEVER** use bare `python` or `python3` - always use full explicit path with `-m` flag.

---

## üìÅ Directory Structure

Standard directory structure (maintained by `/organize` command):

- `00_NEW_DOCUMENTS_INBOX/` - Staging area for new files
- `01_CASE_OVERVIEW/` - Case summary, timeline, parties
- `02_PLEADINGS/` - All court filings
- `03_DISCOVERY/` - Discovery requests/responses
- `04_EVIDENCE/` - Evidence documents
- `05_CORRESPONDENCE/` - Letters and communications
- `06_RESEARCH/` - Legal research and case law
- `07_DRAFTS_AND_WORK_PRODUCT/` - Working documents
- `08_REFERENCE/` - Court rules, forms, templates

**ALWAYS** maintain this organization throughout session.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Commands

### Core Commands

- **`/check-env`** - Check Python environment and API keys
- **`/organize`** - Organize files from inbox (guidance-only, always free)
- **`/deep-research-prep`** - Generate comprehensive prompt for Claude.ai Deep Research
- **`/research [topic]`** - Quick legal research on specific topic
- **`/strategy`** - Get strategic recommendations
- **`/draft [type]`** - Draft legal document
- **`/review [file]`** - Run adversarial review

See `.claude/COMMANDS_REFERENCE.md` for detailed command documentation.

---

## üîß wepublic_defender CLI Usage

### Basic Invocation

Use full Python path from env_info.json:

```bash
# Environment check
<python_path> -m wepublic_defender.cli.check_env

# Initialize case (if not already done)
<python_path> -m wepublic_defender.cli.init_case

# Run agent (guidance mode - free)
<python_path> -m wepublic_defender.cli.run_agent --agent self_review --file draft.md --mode guidance

# Run agent (external-llm mode - costs money)
<python_path> -m wepublic_defender.cli.run_agent --agent citation_verify --file draft.md --mode external-llm --web-search
```

### Multi-Model Behavior

If agent has 2+ models configured, **ALL run in parallel** by default (adversarial redundancy, 2x cost).

Override:
```bash
# Force single model
--model gpt-5

# Force both models
--run-both
```

###  ‚è±Ô∏è Bash Command Timeouts for LLM Agent Calls (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS specify extended timeout when running agents in external-llm mode via Bash.**

The Bash tool has a default 120-second (2-minute) timeout that will kill long-running LLM calls even if the Python/LLM timeouts are configured longer.

#### Required Timeout

- **Minimum: 600000ms (10 minutes)** for any `--mode external-llm` command
- Applies to ALL agents: self_review, citation_verify, opposing_counsel, drafter, etc.
- Without this parameter, Bash will terminate the process at exactly 2 minutes

#### Why This Matters

- Large documents (10K+ tokens) with web search can take 3-5 minutes per model
- Running 2 models in parallel means waiting for the slower one to complete
- gpt-5 with high reasoning effort can take 2-4 minutes for complex legal documents
- Grok-4 with web search may take 1-3 minutes depending on search results

#### Correct Usage

‚úÖ **CORRECT - Includes timeout parameter:**

```python
Bash(
    command="C:/Users/jack/.conda/envs/wepublic_defender/python.exe -m wepublic_defender.cli.run_agent --agent self_review --file draft.md --mode external-llm --verbose",
    description="Run self_review agent",
    timeout=600000  # 10 minutes - REQUIRED!
)
```

‚ùå **WRONG - Will timeout at 2 minutes:**

```python
Bash(
    command="C:/Users/jack/.conda/envs/wepublic_defender/python.exe -m wepublic_defender.cli.run_agent --agent self_review --file draft.md --mode external-llm --verbose",
    description="Run self_review agent"
    # Missing timeout parameter - will be killed at 120 seconds!
)
```

#### When to Use Extended Timeout

Always use `timeout=600000` for:
- Any `--mode external-llm` agent call
- Any `--run-both` flag (runs 2 models in parallel)
- Any agent with `--web-search` enabled
- Any operation on documents > 5,000 tokens
- Citation verification (always needs extended timeout)

#### Incremental Result Saving

The CLI automatically saves each model's results immediately upon completion to `.wepublic_defender/reviews/` directory. This prevents data loss if one model times out while the other completes successfully.

Results are saved as:
- JSON: `.wepublic_defender/reviews/{agent}_{model}_{timestamp}.json`
- Markdown: `.wepublic_defender/reviews/{agent}_{model}_{timestamp}.md`

This means even if the Bash command times out, any models that completed before the timeout will have their results preserved.

## üìù File Naming Conventions

- Use UPPERCASE for document types: `MOTION_TO_DISMISS.docx`
- Include dates for versions: `MOTION_TO_DISMISS_2025-10-15.docx`
- Use underscores, not spaces: `DISCOVERY_RESPONSE_01.docx`
- Use version numbers for drafts: `MOTION_v1.md`, `MOTION_v2.md`, `MOTION_FINAL.md`

---

## üíæ State Tracking (.database)

Claude manages lightweight state directly:

**Ledger**: `.database/organization_log.md`
- Format: `timestamp | action | src | dst | notes`
- Append one line per file management action

**Index**: `.database/organization_index.json`
- JSON object keyed by path
- Tracks what's been processed to avoid duplicate work

Read index before organizing to skip already-processed files/folders.

---

## üîç Citation Verification

### CourtListener Setup (If Missing)

If `COURTLISTENER_TOKEN` not in `.env`:
1. Open https://www.courtlistener.com/api/
2. Create API token (free account)
3. Add to `.env`:
   ```
   COURTLISTENER_TOKEN=your_token_here
   COURTLISTENER_USER_AGENT=WePublicDefender/0.1
   ```

### Citation Caching Protocol

1. Before verifying citation, check `06_RESEARCH/CITATIONS_LOG.md`
2. If case recently verified for same proposition, skip recheck (unless context changed)
3. After verification, update `CITATIONS_LOG.md` with:
   - Good law status
   - Holding
   - Key quotes + pin cites
   - Propositions supported
   - Sections it applies to

**Prefer South Carolina and Fourth Circuit authority when relevant. Always include pin cites.**

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Quality Standards

**ALWAYS follow `.claude/protocols/LEGAL_WORK_PROTOCOL.md`** for quality standards.

Critical principles:
- Research extensively BEFORE drafting (never draft without research)
- ALWAYS run adversarial review before filing
- Analyze LLM feedback critically against research (don't blindly accept)
- Triple-check all citations
- Track API costs and report after expensive operations

---

## üí∞ Cost Management

- Monitor token usage throughout session
- Provide cost summary after major tasks
- Check `.wepublic_defender/usage_log.csv` regularly
- Alert if costs exceed $10 for single operation
- Default to guidance mode (free) unless user specifically requests external-llm

---

## üìã Logging and Debugging

- All agent runs log to `.wepublic_defender/logs/wpd.log`
- Include log path when reporting issues
- Check log for model selections, parse results, citation updates

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: File Editing on Windows

**When using Edit/MultiEdit on Windows, MUST use backslashes `\` in file paths:**

‚ùå WRONG: `file_path: "D:/repos/file.txt"` (will error)

‚úÖ CORRECT: `file_path: "D:\\repos\\file.txt"` (works)

Bash commands use forward slashes `/`, but Edit tool requires backslashes on Windows.

---

## üîó Workflow Integration

This orchestrator file is **lightweight and focused on routing**. Detailed workflows are in separate files:

- **First time setup**: `.claude/workflows/first_case_init.md`
- **Session start**: `.claude/workflows/session_start_checklist.md`
- **Post-compacting**: `.claude/workflows/post_compact_recovery.md`
- **Legal documents**: `.claude/workflows/legal_document_workflow.md`
- **Quality standards**: `.claude/protocols/LEGAL_WORK_PROTOCOL.md`

**Always start by checking the routing logic at the top of this file to determine which workflow to follow.**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Reminders

- This is federal court litigation - mistakes have consequences
- Always verify citations before filing
- Human lawyer must review and sign all filings
- AI is an assistant, not an attorney
- When in doubt, ask the user

---

**Now execute the workflow routing logic at the top of this file to determine your next action.**
