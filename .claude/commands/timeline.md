## Implementation Notes

This is a **guidance-mode-only** command (like /organize) - no external API calls.

Claude Code:
1. Reads `.wepublic_defender/case_timeline.md`
2. Performs requested action (view/add/update)
3. Updates file directly using Edit tool (remember backslashes on Windows!)
4. Updates `.wepublic_defender/session_notes.md` to reflect timeline change
5. Confirms action to user

**No Python script needed** - this is pure file manipulation by Claude Code.
