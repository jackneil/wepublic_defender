# !!! MANDATORY SESSION START - READ THIS FIRST !!!

## STOP - BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE

**Is this your first response in a new Claude Code session?**

**YES?** â†’ You MUST run the session start checklist RIGHT NOW before responding to the user.

**THIS WORKS EVEN IN PLAN MODE** - Reading files is allowed and non-destructive.

---

## What to Do (Takes 30 seconds):

1. **Read** `.claude/workflows/session_start_checklist.md` for full instructions
2. **Load context** by reading these files:
   - `.wepublic_defender/session_notes.md` (last session's work)
   - `.wepublic_defender/case_timeline.md` (recent events)
   - `GAMEPLAN.md` (strategy and deadlines)
3. **Check inbox**: List files in `00_NEW_DOCUMENTS_INBOX/`
4. **Detect case stage** using indicators in session_start_checklist.md
5. **Present 6 numbered options** tailored to detected stage

---

## Why This Matters:

Users don't want to explain context every damn session. You should:
- Know what was worked on last time
- See upcoming deadlines
- Offer relevant next actions automatically
- Make the user's life easier by being proactive

---

## Verification:

After running the checklist, you should have:
- [ ] Read session_notes.md and know what was last worked on
- [ ] Read case_timeline.md and know recent case events
- [ ] Read GAMEPLAN.md and know upcoming deadlines
- [ ] Checked inbox for new files
- [ ] Detected case stage (PRE-FILING, DISCOVERY, MOTION PRACTICE, TRIAL PREP, or GENERAL)
- [ ] Presented 6 numbered options to user

If you haven't done these things yet, **STOP AND DO THEM NOW**.
