# WePublicDefender Documentation

Welcome to WePublicDefender - your AI legal assistant that helps you fight corporations without paying $400/hour for a lawyer.

## What is WePublicDefender?

WePublicDefender is a software system that uses multiple artificial intelligence models to help you prepare legal documents. Think of it like having 5 different lawyers review your case - each one looking for different problems, checking your facts, and making sure your documents are ready for court.

## Quick Example

Here's what using WePublicDefender looks like:

```
You: Help me review my motion to dismiss

Claude: I'll run a comprehensive review of your motion. Let me check it for:
- Legal issues and missing arguments
- Citation validity
- How opposing counsel might attack it

[5 minutes later]

Claude: Review complete. Found 3 issues to fix:
1. Missing jurisdiction statement in paragraph 2
2. Citation on page 4 was overruled last year
3. Opposing counsel will likely argue you waived this defense

Would you like me to fix these issues?
```

- "The AI told me to" is not a valid legal defense
