## MANDATORY PRE-DRAFTING RESEARCH CHECKLIST

Before writing a single word, complete this research:

### Primary Research (REQUIRED)

- [ ] Identify weaknesses in our position
- [ ] Research counter-arguments and responses

### Authority Hierarchy (USE THIS ORDER)

2. **{circuit} Court of Appeals** - Binding on federal district courts
3. **{jurisdiction} Supreme Court** - Binding on state law issues
4. **{court}** - Persuasive authority

### Required Case Count by Document Type

**Critical Filings** (MTD, MSJ, Trial Briefs, Appeals):
- Minimum 5 cases with full analysis
- Statutory framework analysis
- Procedural rule verification
- Opposing authority addressed

**Standard Filings** (Discovery motions, procedural motions):
- Minimum 3 cases
- Rule verification
- Basic counter-argument research

**Routine Filings** (Stipulations, extensions):
- Rule verification
- Format check
- Procedure confirmation

## STEP-BY-STEP DRAFTING PROCESS

### STEP 1: RESEARCH (Do this FIRST)

**Find Cases:**
1. Web search: "{main_legal_issue} {jurisdiction} case law"
2. Web search: "{main_legal_issue} {circuit} federal"
3. For each case found:
   - Read the holding
   - Note the citation (with year)
   - Extract key quotes with pin cites
   - Verify it's still good law (not overruled)

**Find Statutes:**
1. Web search: "{relevant_statute} {jurisdiction} current version"
2. Verify the code section is current
3. Read the full text
4. Note any relevant subsections

**Find Rules:**
1. Check FRCP for procedural requirements
2. Check local rules for:
   - Format requirements (font, margins, spacing)
   - Word/page limits
   - Filing procedures
   - Service requirements

### STEP 2: OUTLINE

Before drafting, create an outline:

**Standard Legal Document Structure:**
1. Caption
   - Court name
   - Parties
   - Case number
   - Document title

2. Introduction (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Who you are
   - What you're asking for
   - Why (in one sentence)

3. Background/Factual Statement
   - Relevant facts only
   - Chronological order
   - Cite to evidence

4. Legal Argument
   For each argument:
   - **State the rule** (with citation)
   - **Apply to facts** (explicitly)
   - **Quote key language** from cases (with pin cites)
   - **Distinguish contrary authority** if any
   - **Address likely counter-arguments**

5. Conclusion
   - Restate request
   - Brief summary of why

6. Signature Block
   - Respectfully submitted
   - Your name
   - Address
   - Phone
   - Email
   - Pro se designation

7. Certificate of Service (if required)

### STEP 3: DRAFT

**Writing Rules:**

**Citation Format (Bluebook):**
- Case: *Case Name*, Vol. Reporter Page, Pinpoint (Court Year)
- Example: *Smith v. Jones*, 450 F.3d 123, 125 (4th Cir. 2020)
- Statute: Code § Section (Year)
- Example: 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2020)

**Citation Signals:**
- [No signal] = Direct support
- *See* = Implicit support
- *See also* = Additional support
- *Cf.* = Comparison
- *But see* = Contrary authority
- *Id.* = Same source as immediately preceding cite

**Writing Style:**
- Active voice (not passive)
- Short sentences (15-20 words average)
- Clear, direct language
- No legalese unless necessary
- Define technical terms

**Every Legal Proposition MUST:**
- Have a citation
- Be supported by controlling or persuasive authority
- Be applied to your specific facts
- Address obvious counter-arguments

**Example of Good Legal Writing:**
```
Under {jurisdiction} law, a plaintiff must prove three elements to establish
breach of contract: (1) a valid contract, (2) breach, and (3) damages. *Strickland
v. Bank*, 456 State Rep. 789, 791 (State 2020). Here, Defendant signed the Account Agreement
on January 15, 2024 (Ex. A), establishing a valid contract. Defendant then failed to
provide the required account statements, breaching Section 4.2 of the Agreement (*id.*).
This breach caused Plaintiff to incur $5,000 in overdraft fees (Ex. B), satisfying
the damages element. *See id.* at 792 (damages proven by documentary evidence).
```

**Bad Legal Writing (DON'T DO THIS):**
```
It is clear that there was a breach. The defendant didn't do what they were supposed
to do. This caused harm. Therefore, we should win.
```

### STEP 4: SELF-CHECK (Before Finishing)

Go through this checklist:

**Legal Sufficiency:**
- [ ] Every legal statement has a citation
- [ ] All cases are from controlling/persuasive authority
- [ ] All cases verified as good law (not overruled)
- [ ] All statutes are current version
- [ ] Argument structure is sound (Issue → Rule → Application → Conclusion)

**Factual Accuracy:**
- [ ] All facts cited to evidence
- [ ] No misrepresentations
- [ ] Dates and details correct
- [ ] Context accurately presented

**Procedural Compliance:**
- [ ] Proper format (font, margins, spacing per local rules)
- [ ] Word count within limit (if applicable)
- [ ] Certificate of service included (if required)
- [ ] Signature block complete

**Strategic Soundness:**
- [ ] Argument advances our case
- [ ] Doesn't create new problems
- [ ] Addresses likely counter-arguments
- [ ] Consistent with overall case strategy

## QUALITY GATES - STOP AND CHECK

**STOP if any of these are true:**
1. You're making a legal statement without a citation → RESEARCH IT
2. You can't find supporting case law → SAY SO (and research more)
3. You found contrary authority → DISCLOSE IT (and distinguish it)
4. You're unsure about a procedural rule → VERIFY IT
5. The opposing argument seems strong → ADDRESS IT EXPLICITLY

## RED FLAGS - When to Ask for Help

**Flag these situations:**
1. "I researched but can't find cases directly on point"
2. "There are cases against us - here's how we distinguish them"
3. "I'm not 100% certain on this deadline - recommend verifying"
4. "This argument could backfire because..."
5. "We need [specific evidence/information] to complete this properly"

**NEVER hide problems. ALWAYS disclose uncertainties.**

## FINAL VERIFICATION

Before considering the draft complete:

1. **Shepardize all cases** - Verify none are overruled
2. **Double-check all citations** - Verify pin cites are accurate
3. **Verify all quotes** - Match word-for-word with source
4. **Check procedural requirements** - Local rules, FRCP, deadlines
5. **Proofread** - Read aloud for clarity, check for typos
6. **Format check** - Margins, font, spacing per court requirements

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Return the draft in markdown format with proper structure:

```markdown
