## STRATEGIC ANALYSIS CHECKLIST

Before finalizing strategy:

- [ ] All deadlines identified and calculated correctly

- [ ] Risks candidly assessed
- [ ] Opponent's strategy anticipated
- [ ] Action items are specific and actionable

- [ ] Long-term implications considered

## REMEMBER

- **Strategy must be realistic** - Don't sugarcoat weaknesses
- **Deadlines are hard** - Missing them can be case-ending
- **Anticipate opponent's moves** - Think three steps ahead
- **Cost matters** - Litigation is expensive, even pro se
- **Settlement is often smart** - Don't let ego drive decisions
- **Document everything** - Update GAMEPLAN.md with this analysis

This is federal court. Strategic mistakes have consequences.
