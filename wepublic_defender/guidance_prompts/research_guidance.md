# Legal Research Guidance for Claude Code

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (from LEGAL_WORK_PROTOCOL.md)

**Rule 1: ALWAYS Research Before Writing**
- Web search for current case law
- Verify statutory citations
- Check court precedents
- Confirm federal rules and procedures

**Authority Hierarchy - USE THIS ORDER:**
1. **U.S. Supreme Court** - Binding on all courts
2. **Circuit Court of Appeals** - Binding on federal district courts
3. **State Supreme Court** - Binding on state law issues
4. **District Court** - Persuasive authority

**Rule: Never Make Shit Up**
- If unsure → RESEARCH MORE
- If can't find supporting law → SAY SO CLEARLY
- If contrary authority exists → DISCLOSE IT
- Use only verified, current law

## Your Task

Research the following legal topic:

**Research Topic:** {topic}

**Case Context:**
- Jurisdiction: {jurisdiction}
- Court: {court}
- Circuit: {circuit}
- Related Claims: {related_claims}

## RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

### STEP 1: DEFINE THE RESEARCH QUESTION

Break down the topic into specific legal questions:

1. **What are the elements?** - What must be proven?
2. **What is the standard?** - Burden of proof, standard of review?
3. **What are the defenses?** - What will opposing side argue?
4. **What are the procedures?** - What rules govern this?
5. **What are the damages/remedies?** - What can be recovered?

### STEP 2: SEARCH STRATEGY

**Primary Authority Search** (DO THIS FIRST):

**For Case Law:**
- Web search: "{topic} {jurisdiction} case law"
- Web search: "{topic} {circuit} federal"
- Web search: "{topic} U.S. Supreme Court"

**For Statutes:**
- Web search: "{relevant statute} {jurisdiction} current version"
- Web search: "{statute name} code section"

**For Rules:**
- Web search: "FRCP {rule number}" or "Fed. R. Civ. P. {number}"
- Web search: "{court} local rules"

**Research Sources (Prioritize These):**
- law.cornell.edu - Free legal resources, current codes
- justia.com - Case law database with citations
- casetext.com - Legal research with shepardizing
- scholar.google.com - Case law search
- findlaw.com - Legal information and statutes
- courtlistener.com - Free case law archive

### STEP 3: EVALUATE EACH SOURCE

For **every case** you find, verify:

- [ ] **Citation**: Full Bluebook citation with year
- [ ] **Good Law**: Not overruled or superseded
- [ ] **Authority Level**: Supreme Court? Circuit? State Supreme? District?
- [ ] **Relevance**: On point or analogous?
- [ ] **Holding**: What did the court actually decide?
- [ ] **Key Quotes**: Exact language with pin cites
- [ ] **Standard Applied**: What test/standard did court use?

For **every statute** you find, verify:

- [ ] **Current**: Is this the current version?
- [ ] **Full Text**: Read the entire section
- [ ] **Cross-References**: Related sections?
- [ ] **Amendments**: Recent changes?

### STEP 4: ORGANIZE YOUR FINDINGS

**Authority Hierarchy Organization:**

**Tier 1 - Controlling Authority (MOST IMPORTANT):**
- U.S. Supreme Court cases
- {circuit} Court of Appeals cases (for federal issues)
- {jurisdiction} Supreme Court cases (for state law)

**Tier 2 - Persuasive Authority:**
- Other Circuit Courts
- {court} District Court cases
- Other state supreme courts (if similar law)

**Tier 3 - Secondary Sources:**
- Legal treatises
- Law review articles
- Restatements
- Practice guides

### STEP 5: ANALYZE EACH LEGAL ISSUE

For each issue, answer:

**The Rule:**
- What is the legal standard/test?
- Which cases establish this rule?
- Quote the key language (with pin cites)

**Application:**
- How have courts applied this rule?
- What facts mattered to courts?
- What distinguishes cases with different outcomes?

**Counter-Arguments:**
- What is the opposing view?
- Which cases support the other side?
- How do we distinguish contrary authority?

**Procedural Requirements:**
- What rules govern this issue?
- What are the deadlines?
- What must be filed/served?

## RESEARCH DEPTH BY ISSUE TYPE

### Critical Issues (Dispositive Motions, Appeals)
**Required:**
- Minimum 5 cases analyzed
- Statutory framework complete
- Procedural rules verified
- Opposing authority addressed
- Recent cases (prefer last 5 years)

### Standard Issues (Discovery, Procedural Motions)
**Required:**
- Minimum 3 cases analyzed
- Rule verification
- Basic counter-argument research
- Cases from last 10 years

### Routine Issues (Extensions, Stipulations)
**Required:**
- Rule verification
- Format requirements
- Procedure confirmation

```

## QUALITY CONTROL CHECKLIST

Before finalizing research:

- [ ] **Citation Verification**: All citations are complete and accurate
- [ ] **Good Law Check**: All cases verified as not overruled
- [ ] **Pin Cites**: All quotes have specific page references
- [ ] **Current Law**: All statutes are current version
- [ ] **Authority Hierarchy**: Controlling authority prioritized
- [ ] **Contrary Authority**: Opposing cases identified and addressed
- [ ] **Procedural Rules**: All applicable rules identified
- [ ] **Practical Application**: Research answers the specific question
- [ ] **Gaps Identified**: Missing information flagged clearly

## RED FLAGS - STOP AND REASSESS

**Flag these situations:**
1. "I can't find any cases on point" → Research more broadly, try analogous issues
2. "All the cases go against us" → Focus on distinguishing factors, alternative theories
3. "The cases conflict" → Identify the trend, which authority controls?
4. "The statute is unclear" → Look for cases interpreting it
5. "I'm not sure if this case is still good law" → Shepardize it thoroughly

## RESEARCH TIPS

**Effective Search Terms:**
- Start broad, then narrow
- Use legal terms of art
- Include jurisdiction in search
- Try different phrasings
- Look at cases cited by relevant cases (citator search)

**Time Management:**
- Critical issues: 2-4 hours of research
- Standard issues: 1-2 hours of research
- Routine issues: 30 minutes of verification

**When to Stop Researching:**
- You've found controlling authority clearly on point
- Pattern is clear across multiple cases
- You have enough to make the argument confidently
- Further research yields repetitive results

**When to Keep Researching:**
- Authority is only persuasive, not controlling
- Cases are old (10+ years)
- You haven't found contrary authority yet (it probably exists)
- The law seems unsettled or evolving

## REMEMBER

- **Primary authority beats secondary authority**
- **Controlling authority beats persuasive authority**
- **Recent cases beat old cases** (if law has evolved)
- **Pin cites are mandatory** for all quotes
- **Disclose contrary authority** - court will find it anyway
- **Be honest about gaps** - better to flag uncertainty than guess

This is federal court. Accurate research is non-negotiable.
