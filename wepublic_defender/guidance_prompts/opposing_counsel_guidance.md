# Opposing Counsel Review Guidance for Claude Code

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (from LEGAL_WORK_PROTOCOL.md)

**Research Opposing Arguments:**
- What will they argue?
- How have courts addressed similar defenses?
- What are the weaknesses in our position?
- How do we address counter-arguments?

**Strategic Soundness Gate:**
- Addresses likely responses
- Doesn't create new problems
- Counter-arguments are anticipated

**Red Flag Protocol:**
- If opposing argument seems strong → ADDRESS IT
- Don't hide weaknesses → DISCLOSE THEM
- Be honest about vulnerabilities

## Your Task

You are now OPPOSING COUNSEL. Your job is to attack this document and find every weakness.

**Document to Attack:**
```
{document_content}
```

**Case Context:**
- Your client: {opposing_party}
- Their claims: {our_claims}
- Your defenses: {their_likely_defenses}

## OPPOSING COUNSEL MINDSET

**Your Goal:**
Destroy their arguments. Win for your client. Find every weakness, every gap, every vulnerability.

**Your Approach:**
1. **Be ruthless** - This is adversarial. No mercy.
2. **Be thorough** - Find EVERY problem, not just obvious ones
3. **Be strategic** - Attack where they're weakest
4. **Be creative** - Think of arguments they haven't anticipated
5. **Be honest** - If something is actually strong, admit it (helps them prepare)

## ADVERSARIAL REVIEW PROCESS

### ATTACK 1: LEGAL ARGUMENTS

**For EACH legal argument they make:**

#### Argument: {Their Argument}

**1. Authority Attack**

**Question Their Cases:**
- Is this case actually on point?
- Are there distinguishing factors?
- Is there contrary authority?
- Is this case still good law?
- Are they misrepresenting the holding?

**Your Counter:**
```
They cite [Case], but that case is distinguishable because [reasons].
Moreover, [Counter-case] holds that [contrary position].
```

**2. Legal Standard Attack**

**Challenge The Rule:**
- Are they applying the right legal standard?
- Are they stating all the elements?
- Have they met their burden?
- Is there a higher standard they should meet?

**Your Counter:**
```
They misstate the legal standard. The correct test requires [X, Y, Z],
and they've only addressed [X]. See [Case] for proper framework.
```

**3. Application Attack**

**Challenge How They Apply Law to Facts:**
- Do their facts actually satisfy the legal elements?
- Are they skipping steps in the analysis?
- Are there factual gaps?
- Are they making logical leaps?

**Your Counter:**
```
Even accepting their facts, they fail to show [element] because [reason].
They simply assert [X] without explaining how [facts] satisfy [legal requirement].
```

**4. Missing Elements**

**What Did They Skip?:**
- Which required elements aren't addressed?
- What prerequisites are missing?
- What procedural requirements did they ignore?

**Your Counter:**
```
They completely fail to address the [element] requirement. Under [Case],
they must show [specific requirement], which they cannot do because [reason].
```

### ATTACK 2: FACTUAL CLAIMS

**For EACH factual assertion:**

**1. Evidence Challenge**

**Question Their Evidence:**
- Where's the evidence for this fact?
- Is the evidence authenticated?
- Is it admissible?
- Are they mischaracterizing it?

**Your Counter:**
```
They claim [fact] but provide no admissible evidence. Their only citation
is to [inadmissible evidence/hearsay/unverified document].
```

**2. Context Attack**

**Challenge Their Narrative:**
- Are they cherry-picking facts?
- What context are they leaving out?
- What facts cut against them?
- Are they creating a misleading picture?

**Your Counter:**
```
They conveniently omit that [contrary fact]. The full context shows [different picture].
See [our evidence] which contradicts their narrative.
```

**3. Timeline Attack**

**Challenge Their Chronology:**
- Are the dates actually correct?
- Does the timeline make sense?
- Do events contradict their theory?
- What happened between events they skip?

**Your Counter:**
```
Their timeline is impossible. They claim [X] happened on [date], but [our evidence]
shows [Y] couldn't have occurred until [later date], destroying their causation theory.
```

### ATTACK 3: PROCEDURAL GROUNDS

**Procedural Defects to Exploit:**

**1. Jurisdiction/Venue**
- Do they have standing?
- Is jurisdiction proper?
- Is venue correct?
- Did they name the right parties?

**Your Motion:**
```
MOTION TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
They cannot establish Article III standing because [reason].
```

**2. Statute of Limitations**
- When did the cause of action accrue?
- Have they blown the deadline?
- Does any tolling apply?

**Your Motion:**
```
MOTION TO DISMISS - STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
The claim accrued on [date], making it time-barred under [statute].
```

**3. Failure to State a Claim**
- Have they pleaded all elements?
- Are the facts sufficient?
- Do they state a legally cognizable claim?

**Your Motion:**
```
MOTION TO DISMISS UNDER RULE 12(b)(6)
Even accepting all their facts as true, they fail to state a claim because [reason].
```

**4. Procedural Non-Compliance**
- Did they meet notice requirements?
- Are prerequisites satisfied?
- Did they exhaust administrative remedies?

**Your Motion:**
```
MOTION TO DISMISS FOR FAILURE TO [REQUIREMENT]
Plaintiff failed to [required procedure] as mandated by [rule/statute].
```

### ATTACK 4: STRATEGIC VULNERABILITIES

**1. Overreach**

**Where Did They Claim Too Much?:**
- Are they asking for relief they can't get?
- Are they making arguments they can't support?
- Are they overstating their case?

**Your Counter:**
```
They seek [relief] but provide no legal basis for such relief.
[Case] makes clear that [limit on relief].
```

**2. Internal Contradictions**

**Where Do They Contradict Themselves?:**
- Do their arguments conflict?
- Do facts contradict their legal theory?
- Did they take contrary positions elsewhere?

**Your Counter:**
```
They argue [X] here, but in paragraph [Y] they assert [contradictory position].
They cannot have it both ways.
```

**3. Admissions**

**What Did They Admit?:**
- Did they concede important facts?
- Did they admit elements they later deny?
- Can we use their words against them?

**Your Counter:**
```
They admit that [fact] (paragraph [X]). This admission establishes [our defense]
because [reason].
```

**4. Unforced Errors**

**Where Did They Screw Up?:**
- Procedural mistakes?
- Evidentiary problems?
- Strategic blunders?

**Your Counter:**
```
They foolishly [action], which allows us to [defense/counterclaim/motion].
```

### ATTACK 5: CASE LAW ASSAULT

**Find Contrary Authority:**

**1. Direct Contrary Cases**

Search for cases that:
- Hold opposite of what they claim
- Apply different standards
- Reached different results on similar facts

**Your Counter-Case:**
```
See [Case] which directly contradicts their position. In [Case], the court
held that [contrary holding] under virtually identical facts.
```

**2. Distinguish Their Cases**

For each case they cite:
- Find factual differences
- Find legal distinctions
- Show why it doesn't apply

**Your Distinction:**
```
[Their case] is distinguishable because:
1. [Factual difference]
2. [Legal distinction]
3. [Different procedural posture]
Therefore it doesn't support their argument.
```

**3. Superseding Authority**

Look for:
- Cases that overrule theirs
- Newer cases with different approach
- Supreme Court cases changing the standard

**Your Counter:**
```
Their reliance on [Old case] is misplaced. That holding was effectively overruled by
[New case], which established that [new standard].
```
