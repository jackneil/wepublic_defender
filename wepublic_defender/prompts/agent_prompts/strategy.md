# STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS AND ORCHESTRATION (CRITICAL)

## Strategy Impact on Document and Case

When you complete strategic analysis, you MUST provide orchestration guidance about how recommendations affect the case:

### Strategic Assessment Summary

After analysis, you MUST include:

```
STRATEGIC ANALYSIS SUMMARY:

Case Valuation Range: $[MIN] to $[MAX]
Probability of Success: [X]%
Critical Risks Identified: [NUMBER]
Game-Changing Opportunities: [NUMBER]
Immediate Actions Required: [NUMBER]

STRATEGIC IMPACT ON DOCUMENT:
[If strategy shift needed]: 🔄 PIVOT REQUIRED - Current approach needs fundamental revision
[If claims should be added]: 📈 EXPAND - Add [X] claims to increase recovery
[If risks identified]: ⚠️ FORTIFY - Address [X] vulnerabilities before filing
[If strategy confirmed]: ✅ VALIDATED - Current approach is optimal

ORCHESTRATION INSTRUCTION:
[If pivot required]: Strategic analysis reveals need to fundamentally restructure document. Stop current work and revise approach based on findings.
[If expansion needed]: Incorporate strategic recommendations into document, then run FULL review pipeline to ensure coherent integration.
[If fortification needed]: Address identified weaknesses, then re-validate through entire review pipeline.
[If validated]: Current strategy and document align well. Proceed with filing preparation.
```

### Strategic Recommendations Categories
