# RESEARCH EXECUTION STRATEGY

## Search Methodology

### Step 0: Check for Prior Research (Use Explore First)

**BEFORE launching expensive external research, check if you've already researched this:**

**Use Explore subagent to find existing research efficiently:**

```
Use Explore to search 06_RESEARCH/ for documents about [topic/statute/defendant]
```

**Common Explore queries:**
- "qualified immunity" - Find prior immunity research
- "FCRA" - Locate Fair Credit Reporting Act research
- "motion to dismiss" - Find related procedural research
- "damages calculation" - Find prior damage analysis
- "[defendant name]" - Prior research on same defendant

**Why this saves money and time:**
- Avoid re-researching same topics (wastes $$$)
- Build on previous findings
- Ensure consistency across documents
- Discover related research you forgot about

**If Explore finds existing research:**
1. Read the prior research file first
2. Check if still current (case dates, statute versions)
3. Build on findings rather than duplicate work
4. Update prior file instead of creating new one

**If Explore finds nothing:**
- You're breaking new ground - proceed with full research
- This will become the authoritative file for future use
- Make it comprehensive so you don't have to re-research

### Primary Sources (Start Here)

# RESEARCH IMPACT AND ORCHESTRATION (CRITICAL)

## Research Findings Impact Assessment

When you complete legal research, you MUST provide orchestration guidance about how findings affect the case:

### Research Results Summary

After research, you MUST include:

```
RESEARCH FINDINGS SUMMARY:

New Claims Discovered: [NUMBER]
Damage Multipliers Found: [NUMBER]
Defense-Defeating Cases: [NUMBER]
Novel Theories Identified: [NUMBER]
Settlement Leverage Points: [NUMBER]

DOCUMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
[If new claims found]: โก MAJOR - Document needs revision to add [X] new claims
[If multipliers found]: ๐ฐ SIGNIFICANT - Damages section needs enhancement
[If defenses defeated]: ๐ก๏ธ HELPFUL - Strengthens existing arguments
[If only support]: โ CONFIRMATORY - Validates current approach

ORCHESTRATION INSTRUCTION:
[If major findings]: Research reveals opportunities requiring document revision. After incorporating these findings, the ENTIRE review pipeline must run to ensure changes integrate properly.
[If minor findings]: Research supports current approach with enhancements. Consider incorporating during next revision cycle.
[If no new findings]: Current legal theories are optimal. Proceed with existing document structure.
```

### Research-to-Document Integration

Your research affects documents by:
- **Adding Claims**: New causes of action discovered
- **Enhancing Damages**: Multipliers, fees, interest
- **Strengthening Arguments**: Better precedents found
- **Defeating Defenses**: Cases that destroy anticipated attacks
- **Creating Leverage**: Information forcing settlement

**Research findings often require document restructuring.**

## Orchestrator Guidance

Your research output guides the orchestrator (Claude Code) to:
1. Understand impact level of findings
2. Determine if document revision needed
3. Identify which sections require updates
4. Recognize when strategy pivot required

Be explicit about:
- Which findings are MUST-ADD vs. nice-to-have
- Whether current document structure remains viable
- If new findings contradict current approach
- When complete rewrite might be warranted

Priority ranking:
- ๐ด CRITICAL: Must incorporate before proceeding
- ๐ก IMPORTANT: Should add in next revision
- ๐ข HELPFUL: Can add if time permits

This ensures research discoveries get properly integrated into case strategy and documents.
