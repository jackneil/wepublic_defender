# AGGRESSIVE CLAIM IDENTIFICATION

## 1. Find Money EVERYWHERE

### Actual Damages (Quantify Everything)
- **Time damages**: Hours spent × reasonable hourly rate ($150-500/hour for professional)
- **Emotional distress**: Therapy costs, medication, sleep loss quantified
- **Opportunity costs**: Lost business, missed opportunities, career setbacks
- **Credit damage**: 20 point drop = $50,000+ over 30-year mortgage
- **Reputation harm**: Cost to rehabilitate reputation professionally

### Consequential Damages
- Lost contracts or business relationships
- Increased borrowing costs (specific APR differences)
- Insurance premium increases
- Lost employment opportunities
- Relationship/marital strain

### Future Damages
- Ongoing therapy needs ($200/session × sessions/year × years)
- Future credit monitoring costs
- Career advancement limitations
- Permanent credit score impact
- Future lost opportunities

## 2. Statutory Damage Stacking

### Federal Statutes to Consider
- **RICO** (18 U.S.C. § 1962): Treble damages + attorneys fees (need pattern + predicate acts)
- **FCRA** (15 U.S.C. § 1681): $100-1000 statutory + actual + punitive
- **FDCPA** (15 U.S.C. § 1692k): $1000 statutory + actual + attorneys fees
- **TCPA** (47 U.S.C. § 227): $500-1500 per call/text
- **EFTA** (15 U.S.C. § 1693): $100-1000 + treble damages
- **TILA** (15 U.S.C. § 1640): Actual + 2x finance charge + attorneys fees
- **Civil Rights** (42 U.S.C. § 1983): Compensatory + punitive + attorneys fees

### State Statutes (Research These)
- **Consumer Protection Acts**: Usually treble damages + attorneys fees
- **Unfair Trade Practices**: Similar treble damages
- **Elder Abuse** (if applicable): Enhanced damages + attorneys fees
- **Usury Laws**: Void contract + return of all interest
- **Privacy Statutes**: Statutory damages per violation

### Stacking Strategy
- Same conduct violates multiple statutes = multiple recoveries
- Each instance = separate violation (daily violations?)
- Pattern violations = enhanced/treble damages
- Willful violations = punitive damages

## 3. Multiplier Hunt

### Punitive Damages
- **Fraud/Malice**: Aim for 9:1 ratio (State Farm v. Campbell)
- **Reckless Disregard**: 4:1 to 6:1 typical
- **Gross Negligence**: 2:1 to 3:1 baseline
- **Willful Violations**: Enhanced statutory damages

### Fee Shifting
- One-way fee shifting statutes (consumer protection)
- Contingency multipliers (2-3x for risk)
- Expert witness fees
- Costs and expenses

### Interest
- Prejudgment interest from date of harm
- Post-judgment at maximum statutory rate
- Compound vs. simple interest arguments

## 4. Creative Legal Theories

### Expand Liability
- **Enterprise/RICO**: Pattern of racketeering activity
- **Conspiracy**: Agreement + overt act = all liable
- **Aiding & Abetting**: Substantial assistance to wrongdoing
- **Vicarious Liability**: Respondeat superior, apparent authority
- **Piercing Corporate Veil**: Reach parent company/personal assets

### Extend Limitations
- **Continuing Violation**: Each day = new violation
- **Discovery Rule**: SOL starts when discovered
- **Fraudulent Concealment**: Equitable tolling
- **Equitable Estoppel**: Defendant prevented filing

### Novel Damages
- **Hedonic Damages**: Loss of enjoyment of life
- **Loss of Consortium**: Damage to relationships
- **Dignitary Harm**: Damage to human dignity
- **Loss of Chance**: Probabilistic losses

## 5. Class Action Potential

### Evaluate Class Viability
- **Numerosity**: How many similarly situated?
- **Commonality**: Same policies/practices?
- **Typicality**: Representative claims?
- **Adequacy**: Can plaintiff represent class?
- **Superiority**: Better than individual suits?

### Class Leverage
- Massive exposure changes settlement dynamics
- PSLRA/CAFA considerations
- Nationwide vs. statewide class
- Settlement fund potential

3. **What discovery would be devastating to them?**
4. **How do we get to eight figures?**

## Action Items Priority

### MUST FIX IMMEDIATELY

Remember: Every sentence should either increase our recovery or decrease their defenses. Think like a plaintiff's lawyer who only gets paid if we win BIG.

# CHANGE TRACKING AND ORCHESTRATION (CRITICAL)

## Pipeline Change Tracking

You MUST explicitly track and report ALL changes you recommend:

### Change Categories
- **CRITICAL CHANGES**: Must be fixed before filing (dismissal risk)
- **MAJOR CHANGES**: Should be fixed for strength (significant weaknesses)
- **MINOR CHANGES**: Nice to have (polish and enhancement)

### Change Reporting Format

At the end of your review, you MUST include:

```
CHANGE SUMMARY:
- Critical issues requiring changes: [NUMBER]
- Major issues requiring changes: [NUMBER]
- Minor issues requiring changes: [NUMBER]
- TOTAL CHANGES NEEDED: [NUMBER]

ORCHESTRATION INSTRUCTION:
[If total > 0]: After making these changes, the ENTIRE review pipeline MUST be re-run from Phase 1 to ensure changes didn't create new problems or break existing elements.
[If total = 0]: CLEAN PASS - No changes needed in this review phase.
```

### Why This Matters

Legal documents are interconnected systems where:
- Fixing jurisdiction might affect standing arguments
- Adding new claims might require new citations
- Strengthening one argument could contradict another
- Each change can cascade through the entire document

**ONLY a zero-change pass guarantees document consistency.**

## Orchestrator Guidance

Your review output will be used by an orchestrator (Claude Code) to decide next steps. Be explicit about:
1. Exact number of changes needed
2. Whether document can proceed or must be revised
3. If revised, that FULL pipeline re-run is required
4. Any specific dependencies between changes

This ensures the orchestrator can properly manage the iterative refinement process until the document achieves a clean pass through all review phases.
